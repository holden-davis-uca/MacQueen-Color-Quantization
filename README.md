Baseline code functionality forked form https://github.com/skythomp16/MacQueen-Color-Quantization

Current codebase:

- Images folder containing various .ppm images to test on.
- mkm.c, the original work from the above repository (used for image input/output functions).
- 3darray.c, the implementation of a color histogram using a 3-D array.
- bst.c, the implementation of a color histogram using a Binary Search Tree.
- testsuite.c, a file combining all previous methods (used for testing timing and comparing methods against each other).
